**School Management Application: Modular System Design Overview**

---

## ðŸ“… Phase 1: Core Modules (MVP)

### 1. **Student Information System (SIS)**

**Purpose:** Manage student data with flexibility for enrollments, dropouts, and re-admissions.

**Structure (Firestore Document DB):**

* `students`

  * Basic info: name, dob, gender, contact, guardian info
  * Academic: current class, previous records
  * Enrollment History: array of class-year records with status (joined/left/rejoined)
  * Status: active/inactive/passed out

**Real-life Case:** A student joins Class 5, leaves mid-year, and returns in Class 6. SIS logs all events without overwriting history.

**Reports & Audits:**

* Enrollment vs. dropouts
* Student history log
* Class-wise student strength

---

### 2. **Class & Section Management**

**Purpose:** Define classes, assign sections, and allocate students and subjects.

**Structure:**

* `classes`

  * name, section, academic year
  * assignedSubjects: list with subjectRef & teacherRef

**Features:**

* Move students between sections
* Define class strength
* Timetable linkage

**Reports:**

* Class capacity reports
* Subject/teacher allocation audit

---

### 3. **Attendance Management (Manual)**

**Purpose:** Record daily attendance manually for both students and staff.

**Structure:**

* `student_attendance`

  * classRef, date, attendanceList
* `staff_attendance`

  * staffRef, date, status, inTime, outTime

**Daily Rule:** Every class must have a faculty present.

**Features:**

* Mark half-day/emergency leave
* Prevent duplicate entries

**Reports:**

* Daily attendance summary
* Absentees list per class
* Staff punctuality log

---

### 4. **Substitution & Guest Faculty Management**

**Purpose:** Handle emergency leaves and external lecturers.

**Structure:**

* `teacher_class_sessions`: actual teacher vs assigned teacher
* `substitutions`: log who filled in, reason, period, and approver
* `external_faculty`: guest/mentor profile
* `guest_sessions`: sessions conducted by outsiders

**Real-life Case:** A Physics teacher takes a half-day; a Chemistry teacher covers one period. Next week, a mentor gives a career talk.

**Reports:**

* Substitution frequency
* Guest session logs
* Missed/uncovered periods

---

### 5. **Teacher & Staff Management**

**Purpose:** Manage profiles of all academic and non-academic staff.

**Structure:**

* `staff`

  * Role (teacher/admin/lab), contact, joining date, current status
  * Skills/Subjects
* `teacher_subject_allocations`: to allow dynamic changes

**Features:**

* Add/edit/transfer roles
* Assign & reassign classes and subjects

**Reports:**

* Teacher subject load
* Active staff directory

---

### 6. **Fee Management (Physical Mode)**

**Purpose:** Track physical fee collections (cash/UPI) with provision for receipts, concessions, and installments.

**Structure:**

* `fee_structures`: class-wise or student-wise breakdown
* `student_fee_accounts`: total due, paid, status
* `fee_payments`: logs of actual transactions

**Real-life Case:** A student pays 10,000 in July and the rest in January. Another receives a 2,000 concession.

**Reports:**

* Daily collection
* Dues list
* Concession usage
* Fee mode breakdown (cash vs UPI)

**Audit Ready:** Timestamped receipts, received by staff, unique payment ID.

---

## ðŸš€ Phase 2: Additional Modules (Optional / Future Scope)

### 7. **Leave Management (LM)**

* Online staff leave applications
* Approvals, auto-substitution trigger
* Integration with attendance gaps

### 8. **Digital Communication Module**

* Send SMS/email for attendance, reminders
* Share notices, exam schedules

### 9. **Exam & Evaluation System**

* Subject-wise assessments
* Grade/marks entry by teachers
* Report card generation

### 10. **Library, Transport, Hostel Management**

* Inventory tracking, bus route maps
* Room allocation and schedules

### 11. **Online Fee Gateway Integration**

* Razorpay, Stripe, UPI scan
* Auto-updates to student accounts
* Parent login access

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Design Principles

* **Modular:** Add/disable any module independently.
* **Manual-first:** Ensure admin control and override.
* **Audit-proof:** Timestamped logs, linked references.
* **Dynamic Roles:** Support multiple roles per user.
* **Future Ready:** Real-time DB (Firestore), ready for web/mobile integration.

## ðŸ“ˆ Reporting Summary by Module

| Module       | Reports                                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SIS          | Active/inactive students, class strength                        |
| Attendance   | Daily/class-wise/staff-wise summary, gaps, late marks           |
| Substitution | Substitution logs, absent sessions, guest visits                |
| Fees         | Paid/pending, mode-wise, concession audit, date range summaries |
| Staff        | Teacher allocations, subject load, skill availability           |

## ðŸ‘¥ Real-Life Use Cases Recap

* Student leaves and rejoins: SIS logs every enrollment.
* Teacher marks half-day: System tracks substitution.
* Guest mentor session: Doesnâ€™t disturb normal attendance but is logged.
* Manual fee collection: Payment entered, reflected in student's account with printed receipt.
* Daily attendance: Forces class-wise teacher presence entry.
